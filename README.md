# Trackable-Demo

⚠️This demo is now deprecated in favor of a more robust JS SPA found here: https://github.com/JamesCopeland/Trackable-Dashboard

## Description
This is the frontend website for my Trackable demo app. The app is simply a task-tracking app that will allow users to create, edit, and delete their tasks 
as well as track their open tasks over time. 

The website is only hosted on Github pages currently. The backend is a simple API built on ASP.Net Core which connects to an Azure SQL database.

The frontend was built using Bootstrap 5 with a starter desktop template.

## Release 0.1
The initial release only includes create and delete functionality and does not have authentication built-in yet.

More releases are to come with more complete functionality and features!
